Simple python script to migrate a JBake blog to Hugo üêç üñã ‚û°Ô∏è üñã

## Run

The Hugo blog must already exist before running the migration.

```

## Caveats

- This is a simple script, nothing fancy, used it once, not battle tested. Make a backup copy of source/destination in case things go wrong.
- Multiple-levels are not handled
